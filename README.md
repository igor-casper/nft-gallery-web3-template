# Casper NFT Redeem App (CEP78)
This project is an updated version of the [CEP47 Redeem App](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/nft-gallery-web3-template), designed to work with the new [CEP78 standard](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-78-enhanced-nft).

## Middleware
Middleware serves as a bridge between the frontend and the Casper network, functioning as a proxy. It incorporates a MongoDB persistence layer for caching data, reducing the need for frequent network queries during user visits. The middleware monitors contract-related events, specifically tracking changes in NFT ownership.

**Note:** the current middleware version operates under the assumption that all NFTs are minted in advance. As a result, it simply transfers ownership from one account (accessible to the middleware) to another when necessary.


## Frontend
The frontend enables users to browse and redeem transferred NFTs using email/code pairs. Additionally, it interfaces with [Casper Wallet](https://www.casperwallet.io) and [Casper Dash](https://casperdash.io) to validate proper generation of user private/public keys.

## Build instructions
1. Install a CEP78 contract as described in the [guide](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-78-enhanced-nft#building-the-contract).
2. Mint the series of NFTs using following metadata and using [casper-cep78-js-client](https://github.com/casper-ecosystem/cep-78-enhanced-nft/tree/dev/client-js). The schema is defined at `middleware/src/schemas/nft.schema.ts` and can be adjusted according to your needs.
```
  description: string;
  external_url: string;
  image: string;
  name: string;
  batch: string;
```

3. Configure the following variables `.env` in an app:
```
# DEV SETUP
MIDDLEWARE_PORT=4000
MIDDLEWARE_URL=http://0.0.0.0:4000/app
MONGO_URL=mongodb:27017

MONGO_DB_NAME=tigers
MONGO_USERNAME=tiger_user
MONGO_PASSWORD=tiger_pass

# CHAIN SETUP
CHAIN_RPC_URL= # RPC-SCHEMA URL
CHAIN_NET_NAME= # NETWORK NAME
CHAIN_EE_URL= # MAIN EVENT STREAM URL
CHAIN_CONTRACT_ADDR= # CONTRACT HASH
CHAIN_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_ADDR= # CONTRACT PACKAGE HASH
CHAIN_PRIV_KEY_VARIANT= # TWO VALID OPTIONS: ED25519 or SECP256K1
CHAIN_PRIV_KEY_BASE64= # ONE LINE PRIVATE KEY BASE64 REPRESENTATION (for example from `casper-client-rs`) eg. `MC4CAQAwBQYDK2VwBCIEIOPkC3OAuMmsclduN3d/i9cYxP2sNzl1/FWWFhJxeLS5`
TOTAL_NFTS_NUM= # TOTAL NUMBER OF MINTED NFTs
```

4. Build the up running `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml build`
5. Launch the app with `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`, initiating the retrieval and storage of minted NFT data from the specified contract into a database.
6. Access the API at `localhost:4000/app` and the frontend at `localhost:3000`.
7. To use the app, insert submissions into the database. Use an example submission with 100 tickets located in the `example/tickets.json` directory. It's recommended to perform this manually using the MONGODB CLI.
